                        The find words page of this project is the second part of this interactive web experience.  This section has the user find the definition for the word picked previously
                        while it is hidden.  When the user hovers over the word it increases in size and changes color so the user can check it.  If the user clicks and it's the wrong, it turns
                        red, if it's right, it turns green and a continue button shows.
