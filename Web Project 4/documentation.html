        <h2>Moving Words Page</h2>
        <div>
        <p>
            The basis for this page was the Anime.js library.  I had to learn it in 
            order to get the words to move within the main box.  Anime.js 
            animates more efficiently than the base animation of css or javascript.
        </p>

        <p>
            Each of the words has an a tag attached to it, so that when you click on
            one it sends the user to the next page.  The SVG image is used as the 
            background for this page.  I used css to modify borders and colors of 
            the elements.
        </p>

        <p>
            I used javascript in order to fix the animation each time the window was
            resized.  I was having a problem where the animation distance of the
            objects would not change when the window was resized.  I found, on stack
            overflow, a way to fix this using an in-built resize function within 
            javascript.
        </p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Search Words Page</h2>
        <div>
        <p>
            The idea of this page is for the user to find the definition for the word
            they chose.  The SVG for this page is a magnifying glass that follows the
            mouse.  I used similar css as the previous page to modify the colors and 
            borders of the elements.  I used percentage elements for the main element's
            height so it increase when the other elements get pushed down by a hovered 
            element growing in size.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the SVG that's following the mouse, I found code on stack overflow. I
            modified it so that it is offset from the mouse a bit and not obstructing 
            the mouse.
        </p>

        <p>
            I used css transitions in order to change the size and color of each of 
            the definition elements as the user mouses over them.  Choosing a wrong
            choice changes it red and choosing the right one makes it green.
        </p>

        <p>
            Choosing the right one makes a button apper in the center of the main 
            element that says "Continue".  hovering over this changes the buttons'
            appearence and clicking it continues on to the next page.
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Display Info Page</h2>

        <div>
        <p>
            This page takes the word and definition that the user selected in the 
            previous pages and displays info about that word and shows gifs related 
            to that term.  I used the "margin: 0 auto" for all but the gifs on this 
            page. I also similar element editing of the previous pages in terms 
            of colors and borders.
        </p>

        <p>
            It displays the roots of the word, gifs from gify, and audio to listen 
            to the pronunciation of the word.  We learned how to get gifs from gify
            back in week 10.
        </p>

        <p>
            I learned how to use audio from w3 schools.  Even though it is fairly simple
            to use, it is something that we did not learn during our time in this class.
            I use a button that when it's pressed, the audio plays.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the bottom there is an SVG of a box.  When you hover over the box, an 
            animation starts that looks like it's lifting the top of the box up.  (NOTE:
            When you hover over the box, the user should allow the animation to play out
            BEFORE removing the cursor from the box or else the animation will glitch).
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Landing Page</h2>

        <div>
        <p>
            For my landing page, I used flex box.  I used flexbox to effectively place 
            and move around each of my div elements. Flexbox allowed me to order each 
            of the elements easily and also allowed for me to easily adjust the position
            when it came to the mobile view.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also used JCarousel in order to make a carousel of clickable images that 
            take the user to each of the different pages.  It is a vertical carousel that
            goes through each of the three interactive pages as well as the Documentation
            page.
        </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Above and Beyond</h2>

        <div>
        <p>
            For above and beyond I did 5 different things, some of them simpler than others.
            One of them was implementing audio into one of my pages.  Even though that is 
            not something that we learned to do it is still fairly simple to implement.  
            There is an audio tag that you can use to define a piece of audio and then use 
            a button to call back to it and use the in-built "play" function to play the
            audio.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another thing I did was use the Resize function for editing elements in 
            javascript as the window resized.  I was originally having issues with 
            animating because the distance of the animation would not change with the 
            change of the screen size.  I was able to find, on stack overflow, the resize
            function within javascript that allowed me to call methods and such that 
            activated only when the window was resized.  So I reset the width and height 
            values used in animating and recalled the animating methods within the resize 
            function.  This resets the animation but uses the proper distance so the 
            words don't move past the bounds.
        </p>

        <p>
            A big part of the first and last pages of my interactive media rely on a
            library called anime.js.  Anime.js is a library that makes animating elements
            easier and more efficient.  I used it in the first page to move back and forth
            between the main elements boundaries.  I also used it in the final page of the 
            interactive media.  I mixed the animation and the SVG images to create an 
            animation with SVG images.  It makes it look like the user is lifting the top of a box
            off its bottom when hovering over it and closing it again when moving off of it.
        </p>

        <p>
            For the second page, I found some javascript on stack overflow to help me.
            I wanted to attach an SVG to the position of the mouse as it moved.  I 
            wasn't sure how to do this so I found some code on stack overflow.  I 
            modified the code so that the SVG would not be directly on top of the 
            mouse and so that the proper element was being selected.  There is not
            much for me to change in this code.
        </p>

        <p>
            The last thing I used for above and beyond was the JCarousel library.
            I used it on my landing page to make space for other elements on the 
            page.  The carousel is a vertical carousel that holds links to each of
            the three different interactive pages as well as this documentation page.
            The JCarousel library made this incredibly easy.  I modified it so that 
            it looks more appropriate for my website but the functionality is
            essentially the same.
        </p>
